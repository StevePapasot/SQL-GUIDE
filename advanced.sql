--Now that you have a grasp of the fundamentals, let's delve into more advanced MySQL concepts:

--1. Joins
-- Joins are used to combine data from multiple tables based on a shared relationship. Common join types include:

-- INNER JOIN: Returns rows where there's a match in both tables based on the join condition.
-- LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table, even if there's no match in the right table.
-- RIGHT JOIN: Opposite of LEFT JOIN, returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
-- FULL JOIN: Returns all rows from both tables, including unmatched rows.
-- Example (INNER JOIN):

--SQL
SELECT orders.id, customers.name, products.name AS product_name
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id
INNER JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.id;

--This query retrieves order information along with customer and product details using appropriate joins.

-- 2. Functions
-- MySQL provides various built-in functions for data manipulation, aggregation, and calculations. These can be incorporated into your SQL statements for more powerful queries.

-- Arithmetic Functions: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN()
-- String Functions: CONCAT(), SUBSTRING(), LENGTH()
-- Date and Time Functions: CURDATE(), NOW(), DATE_ADD(), DATEDIFF()
-- Example (Using COUNT function):

-- SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers FROM customers;

--This query uses the COUNT() function to get the total number of customers in the table.

--3. Views
--Views are virtual tables based on a predefined SQL query. They offer a simplified view of the underlying data and can enhance security by restricting access to specific columns or rows.
--Example (Creating a View):

--SQL
CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE is_active = 1;

--This creates a view named active_customers showing only active customers from the customers table.

-- 4. Stored Procedures
-- Stored procedures are reusable blocks of SQL statements that perform specific tasks. They enhance code modularity, maintainability, and security by centralizing complex logic.

-- Example (Simple Stored Procedure):

-- SQL
--DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE update_customer_email(IN customer_id INT, IN new_email VARCHAR(255))
BEGIN
  UPDATE customers SET email = new_email WHERE id = customer_id;
END //
DELIMITER ;

--This procedure updates the email address for a specific customer using the provided ID and new email.

-- 5. User Management and Security
-- User Accounts: Create user accounts with appropriate privileges to control access to the database and specific objects (databases, tables, etc.).
-- Granting Privileges: Use GRANT statements to assign permissions like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to users for specific tables or the entire database.
-- Security Best Practices: Regularly update MySQL software, enforce strong passwords, and implement access controls to mitigate security risks.
-- Remember, these are just some of the advanced features in MySQL. As you explore further, you'll encounter more sophisticated concepts like transactions, indexing, replication, and optimization techniques.

-- 6. Additional Learning Resources
